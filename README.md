# The Lords of the North - Rayan, Suha, Yoosef, Noor & Matt

Our link : https://github.com/FACN4/lords_of_the_north_w3

## Section 1. Why?

This web app is aimed at Game of Thrones fans who are seeking more information about their favourite character or house and a funny GIF based on the character/house.

This project gave us experience of working with APIs and practicing our HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## Section 2. What?

The website contains a header, a choice of what to search (house or character), a description of the house / character and the GIF.

## Section 3. How?

We began by reading the the project brief together and creating a list of all user requirements.

Next we devised a basic HTML site structure and website architecture together.

Finally we broke into 2 teams, pair programming together, to solve clearly defined issues which we identified together in regular team catch-ups.

## Reference - Requirements

We met the following user stories with our website:

- [ ] Your app queries at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method
- [ ] Your app features some dynamic content
- [ ] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.
- [ ] A well-considered architecture for your app - think back to the workshops from the beginning of this week. Try to modularise your code, or break it down into separate files. Document any key decisions about how you structure your code in your readme!
- [ ] Code: break your JavaScript down into small functions with a clear input and output; this will make it easy to write tests
- [ ] Tests: you must write tests!
- [ ] Design: aim for a responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Accessibility: same as always, we'll be running your code through accessibility checkers
- [ ] Take appropriate measures when it comes to concealing private information (i.e. your API key!)
